# AutoML

## Definition
Automated Machine Learning (AutoML) automates the end-to-end process of applying machine learning to real-world problems. This includes data preprocessing, feature engineering, model selection, hyperparameter tuning, model evaluation, and deployment.

## Benefits
- **Saves Time and Resources:** Automates repetitive tasks and accelerates the development process.
- **Reduces Need for Extensive Expertise:** Simplifies complex processes, making machine learning accessible to non-experts.
- **Provides High-Quality Models:** Utilizes sophisticated algorithms to generate optimized models.

## Popular AutoML Tools
- **Google AutoML:** A suite of machine learning products by Google that allows developers to train high-quality models with minimal effort.
- **H2O.ai AutoML:** An open-source platform that automates the machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing and model tuning.
- **AutoKeras:** An open-source software library built on Keras, providing AutoML functionality for deep learning.
- **Auto-sklearn:** An automated machine learning toolkit and a drop-in replacement for a scikit-learn estimator.
- **TPOT:** An open-source genetic programming-based AutoML system that optimizes machine learning pipelines.
