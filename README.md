## Getting Started
To get started with this project, follow these steps:

### Set Up the Environment:
1. **Install Python 3.x** and Jupyter Notebook.
2. **Create and activate a Conda virtual environment**.
   ```bash
   conda create --name ml-cloud-env python=3.8
   conda activate ml-cloud-env
   ```
3. **Install necessary packages** listed in `requirements.txt`.
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### Download Datasets:
1. Download the training dataset from [link 1](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1XmoUF7CC2yfw1xOnh5k4EvYMKHjYnIKK/view?usp=sharing) and save it as `data/sentiment_analysis_train.csv`.
2. Download the test dataset from [link 2](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1RQMhhONxTUflWciZaQzwixyokTMkkrv_/view?usp=sharing) and save it as `data/sentiment_analysis_test.csv`.

### Run Notebooks:
1. Open and run `notebooks/data_exploration.ipynb` for data exploration.
2. Open and run `notebooks/model_training.ipynb` for model training and evaluation.

### Deploy Models:
1. Use scripts in the `scripts` directory for data preprocessing and model deployment.
